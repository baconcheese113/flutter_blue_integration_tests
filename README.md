# flutter_blue_integration_tests

Sample project demonstrating how to implement integration tests with Flutter_Blue_Plus

The most minimal solution demonstrating how to test flutter projects with bluetooth/BLE hardware integrations 

This does require abstracting your bluetooth functionality to a Provider or service that can be injected

## Running tests

Run integration tests with
```shell
flutter test integration_test
```
